# Hi, I'm Adithya 👋

## Cybersecurity & networking enthusiast exploring packet analysis, encrypted traffic behavior, and system-level development in Java and Linux.

---

## 🚧 Featured Project: **Encrypted Traffic Visualizer**

A SOC-style network telemetry tool that captures, classifies, and enriches encrypted flows — **without decrypting packets**.  
Built to help understand how modern encrypted traffic behaves on real networks.

**Highlights**
- Real-time packet capture via **Pcap4J**
- Encrypted flow classification:
  - VPN tunnels (OpenVPN / WireGuard / IPSec)
  - DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
  - Enterprise traffic (Teams / Office 365)
  - Browser traffic (Chrome / Google)
  - Cloud services (AWS / Azure / GCP / OVH / Linode)
  - Local LAN traffic
- Autonomous System (ASN) & Organization enrichment
- Country and Geo metadata lookup
- **JavaFX** SOC dashboard for visualization
- Fully passive (no MITM, no decryption, no DPI)
- Runs on Windows with Java 17+ and Npcap

## 📈 Roadmap – What I’m Building Next

I'm currently improving my cybersecurity engineering skills through real, hands-on projects.  
Upcoming areas of focus:

### 🔸 **Short-Term (1–2 months)**
- TLS/Traffic fingerprinting (JA3 / JA3S)
- VPN & DoH detection heuristics
- System/network automation in Python
- Linux networking & packet inspection

### 🔸 **Mid-Term (3–6 months)**
- Red-team tooling (local automation)
- Threat visibility dashboards
- Passive device fingerprinting (TTL / TCP / MAC OUI)
- C2 beaconing behavior detection

### 🔸 **Long-Term (6+ months)**
- Cloud security fundamentals
- SOC workflow automation
- Blue team telemetry & enrichment pipelines

My overall direction: **Network-focused cyber engineering & traffic visibility.**
